This library provides format strings for Ada with a more ergonomic and
regular interface than constructing strings through manual append
operations.

The primary interface consists of three functions: Create, Format, and
To_String.

The string syntax is simple, using "{}" to denote holes where the
string values are filled in and "\" as an escape character to express
a literal "{" or "}" when required. For this first iteration of the
library there are no other in-string format or type configurations.

Format is a generic function that can be instantiated to any type that
provides an Image aspect. The following example will demonstrate.

with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with Format_Strings; use Format_Strings;

procedure Main is
   procedure Format_Integer is Format (Integer);
   F : Format_String := Create("Replace \{\} with {}, an integer.");
begin
   Format_Integer (F, 2025);
   Put (To_String (F));
end Main;
